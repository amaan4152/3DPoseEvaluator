# NIST 3D Pose Estimation Evaluator

## Description
Generate 3D pose data from an arbitrary video sequence utilizing GAST-NET, VIBE, and Blazepose
as the 3D monocular pose estimation algorithms. Evaluate the 3D pose data against the ground-truth
OTS data to generate a comparison study. The 3D pose data is evaluated via the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE)
and Percent Joints Detected (PJD) to compare between the various 3D pose estimation algorithms.
